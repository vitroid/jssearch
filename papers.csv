The residence time of inhibitor molecules bound to the hydrate surface and the intrinsic growth rate of the clathrate hydrate without KHIs are key ingredients of the model. The binding free energies of the monomer, dimer, tetramer, and octamer of a KHI, polyvinylcaprolactam (PVCap), are calculated using molecular dynamics simulations to estimate the residence times, which are far beyond the feasible simulation time. Our model accounts for the kinetic inhibition mechanism while reproducing experimental data of the size dependence of PVCap very well. We demonstrate that this model explains why blends of high and low-molecular-weight polymers show better performance than the KHI with a unimodal molecular weight distribution and why quaternary ammonium cations are good KHIs for tetrahydrofuran hydrate although they cannot inhibit formation of natural gas hydrates.","","","","",""

Some ultralow-density ices, which were predicted to be thermodynamically metastable under negative pressures on the basis of the quasi-harmonic approximation, can exist only in a narrow pressure range at very low temperatures because they are mechanically fragile due to the large distortion in the hydrogen bonding network. By contrast, relatively dense ices such as ice Ih and ice XVI withstand large negative pressure. Consequently, various ices appear one after another in the phase diagram. The phase diagram of ice under negative pressure exhibits a different complexity from that of positive pressure because of the mechanical instability.","","","Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Okayama 700-8530, Japan.

This enables to investigate complete phase behaviors of clathrate hydrates in the whole space of the thermodynamic variables, not only temperature and pressure but also composition, with only the intermolecular interactions as input parameters. A complete phase diagram of clathrate hydrate is settled with this method, specifically the region enclosed by the hydrate/water and hydrate/guest phase boundaries where a clathrate hydrate is the only stable phase. The method is applied to methane clathrate hydrate, which results in an excellent agreement in dissociation pressure with the experimental observations. It is found that the hydrate/water phase boundary is significantly affected by the phase transition of water from ice to liquid. This transition limits the stable area of the clathrate hydrate terminated at the dissociation temperature, which otherwise exhibits unphysical divergence. It is essential to choose a pressure as an independent variable so as to calculate the accurate phase equilibria in composition space. The present method establishes a pressure-temperature-composition relation for a single stable phase of clathrate hydrate as well as recovering its temperature dependence of the dissociation pressure.","","","Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Science, Okayama University , Okayama 700-8530, Japan.","en","Research Article"

Water-soluble ethylene oxide is chosen as a guest species to avoid problems associated with the presence of the gas phase in the simulation cell such as slow crystal growth. A PVCap dodecamer adsorbs irreversibly on the hydrate surface which grows at supercooling of 3 K when the hydrophobic part of two pendent groups are trapped in open cages at the surface. The amide hydrogen bonds make no contribution to the adsorption. PVCap can adsorb on various crystallographic planes of sI hydrate. This is in contrast to antifreeze proteins, each of which prefers a specific plane of ice. The trapped PVCap gives rise to necessarily the concave surface of the hydrate. The crystal growth rate decreases with increasing surface curvature, indicating that the inhibition by PVCap is explained by the Gibbs-Thomson effect.","","","Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Science , Okayama University , Okayama 700-8530 , Japan.","en","Research Article"

The new phase is structurally quite similar to an ice phase originally found to be a precursor in the course of the homogeneous nucleation of ice VII in liquid water. A part of the water molecules in these ice phases can rotate easily because the number of hydrogen bonds in them is less than four, and thus they can be regarded as partial plastic phases. A rough estimate suggests that these phases are thermodynamically more stable than either ice VI or ice VII for 3 GPa < P < 18 GPa at T = 300 K. Although the partial plastic phases would be metastable states at any point in the phase diagram of real water, they might be realized experimentally with the aid of dopants and/or solid surfaces.","","","Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology and ‡Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Science, Okayama University , Okayama 700-8530, Japan.","en","Research Article"

In this paper, we compare the crystal growth rates of THF hydrate and ice using molecular dynamics simulations. It is demonstrated that the crystal growth of THF hydrate is much slower than that of ice. The growth rates of THF hydrate significantly deviate from a standard kinetic model known as the Wilson–Frenkel model, whereas it reproduces the temperature dependence of the growth rate of ice. The slow crystal growth and the deviation from the Wilson–Frenkel model are attributed to the trapping of THF molecules in open small cages at the hydrate surface. We calculate the free energy profile of a THF molecule transferring from the bulk solution phase to the hydrate surface using the umbrella sampling technique. It is shown that a THF molecule trapped in an open small cage needs to cross one or two free energy barriers to escape from the surface region. We also refer to the similarity between the mechanism of slow growth of THF hydrate and the effect of kinetic hydrate inhibitors.","","","","",""

The thermodynamic stability of a set of hydrogen-ordered ice II variants relative to ice II is evaluated theoretically. It is found that ice II is more stable than the disordered variants so generated as to satisfy the simple ice rule due to the lower zero-point energy as well as the pair interaction energy. The residual entropy of the disordered ice II phase gradually compensates the unfavorable free energy with increasing temperature. The crossover, however, occurs at a high temperature well above the melting point of ice III. Consequently, the hydrogen-disordered phase does not exist in nature. The thermodynamic stability of partially hydrogen-disordered ices is also scrutinized by examining the free-energy components of several variants obtained by systematic inversion of OH directions in ice II. The potential energy of one variant is lower than that of the ice II structure, but its Gibbs free energy is slightly higher than that of ice II due to the zero-point energy. The slight difference in the thermodynamic stability leaves the possibility of the partial hydrogen-disorder in real ice II.","","","Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Okayama University , 3-1-1 Tsushima-naka, Okayama 700-8530, Japan.

An individual water molecule possesses neither a chiral center nor a twisted conformation that can cause spontaneous chiral resolution. However, an aggregation of water molecules will naturally give rise to a collective chirality. Such homochiral domains possess obvious topological and geometrical orders and are energetically more stable than the average. However, homochiral domains cannot grow into macroscopic homogeneous structures due to geometrical frustrations arising from their icosahedral local order. Homochiral domains are the major constituent of supercooled liquid water and the origin of heterogeneity in that substance, and are expected to be enhanced in low-density amorphous ice at lower temperatures.","","","Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, 3-1-1 Tsushima, Okayama 700-8530, Japan.","en","Research Article"

We calculate the free energy profile for transferring a solute molecule from bulk water to the hydrate surface for various molecules. Spherical solutes with a diameter of ∼0.5 nm are significantly stabilized at the hydrate surface, whereas smaller and larger solutes exhibit lower adsorption affinity than the solutes of intermediate size. The range of the attractive force is subnanoscale, implying that this force has no effect on the macroscopic mass transfer of guest molecules in crystal growth processes of gas hydrates. We also examine the adsorption mechanism of a kinetic hydrate inhibitor. It is found that a monomer of the kinetic hydrate inhibitor is strongly adsorbed on the hydrate surface. However, the hydrogen bonding between the amide group of the inhibitor and water molecules on the hydrate surface, which was believed to be the driving force for the adsorption, makes no contribution to the adsorption affinity. The preferential adsorption of both the kinetic inhibitor and the spherical molecules to the surface is mainly due to the entropic stabilization arising from the presence of cavities at the hydrate surface. The dependence of surface affinity on the size of adsorbed molecules is also explained by this mechanism.","","","Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Okayama University , Okayama, 700-8530, Japan.

This difference arises from the opposite effects of the two thermodynamic inhibitors on the hydration free energy of methane. The dissociation rate of methane hydrate is increased by the formation of methane bubbles in the aqueous phase because the bubbles absorb surrounding methane molecules. It is found that both methanol and NaCl facilitate the bubble formation. However, their mechanisms are completely different from each other. The presence of ions enhances the hydrophobic interactions between methane molecules. In addition, the ions in the solution cause a highly non-uniform distribution of dissolved methane molecules. These two effects result in the easy formation of bubbles in the NaCl solution.

The prior works have predicted that the phase transition between ice VII and plastic ice is a first-order transition on the ground of a weak hysteresis and so on. A rigorous survey in the present report, however, augments their prediction with new evidence that a first-order phase transition line gives way to a second-order one at higher pressures, where a tricritical point joins these phase boundaries together. Critical phenomena are also observed whereby, other than that associated with the hypothetical critical point in the deeply supercooled state, which could influence the physical properties in a wide range of temperatures and pressures. A new critical behavior is affirmed by the result that the scaling law holds at any pressure on the second-order phase transition line for which the critical exponents are estimated. We introduce an appropriate order parameter to obtain the Landau free energy functional and the change in the functional against temperature accounts for the phase behaviors.

The hydrogen-bond correlation function of plastic ice decays in a way similar to liquid but it converges to a finite value as seen in ice VII, reflecting the rotational motion of the water molecule at the fixed location.

Relative stability among various morphologies is examined in terms of the chemical potential of water of clathrate hydrates in equilibrium with guest gases. This evaluation is performed by calculating the free energy of cage occupancy according to the standard statistical mechanical theory with the aid of the Yarmolyuk and Kripyakevich's rule on the Frank-Kasper type alloys to estimate the numbers of cages of various types. Thus, a comprehensive interpretation of the selectivity of crystalline structures is successfully made. We explain why two major structures are stable in most of the thermodynamic conditions and establish a relation between polymorphism of clathrate hydrate and the guest size and other parameters, thereby suggesting a way to find a new clathrate hydrate by appropriate choice of the guest species and/or the thermodynamic properties. It is found that there is a small room in the above parameter space for the other structure than the major two to be the most stable, including a new structure.

It was predicted that plastic ice intervenes between ice VII and liquid water, in which diffusion is suppressed but rotation is allowed. In the present work, the structure in plastic ice is explored from both local and global view points and focus is placed on the local arrangement, the extent of deviation from the ideal lattice position, and the hydrogen-bonded patterns. The roles of the attractive interaction and the repulsive part of Lennard-Jones potential are also examined. It is found that the higher interaction energy in plastic ice induces a large dislocation of water molecules, which eventually conducts a facile rotation. There are a large amount of hydrogen-bonds which do not orient to the tetrahedral directions. These orientational defects give rise to fusion of the two interpenetrating sublattices of ice VII leading to a plastic phase rather than defect-containing ice VII, which results in a unique network structure of the plastic ice.","","","Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan.","en","Research Article"

The amplitude in the low pressure ices increases with compression, while the opposite trend is observed in the medium and high pressure ices. The amplitude of the oxygen atom does not differ from that of hydrogen in low pressure ices apart from the contribution from the zero-point vibrations. This is accounted for by the coherent but opposite phase motions in the mixed translational and rotational vibrations. A decoupling of translation-dominant and rotation-dominant motions significantly reduces the vibrational amplitudes in any ice form. The amplitudes in ice III are found to be much larger than any other crystalline ice form. In order to investigate the vibrational mode characteristics, the moment ratio of the atomic displacements for individual phonon modes, called the inverse participation ratio, is calculated and the degree of the phonon localization in crystalline and amorphous ices is discussed. It is found that the phonon modes in the hydrogen-ordered ice forms are remarkably spread over the entire crystal having propagative or diffusive characteristic, while many localized modes appear at the edges of the vibrational bands, called dissipative modes, in the hydrogen-disordered counterparts. The degree of localization is little pronounced in low density amorphous and high density amorphous due to disordering of oxygen atoms.","","","Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Science, Okayama University, Okayama 700-8530, Japan.","en","Research Article"

The structures of polycrystalline ice are prepared by growing ice particles in supercooled water. An order parameter developed recently is used to characterize local structures in terms of the liquid-liquid phase transition scenario. It is shown that the grain boundaries and triple junctions in ice are structurally similar to low-density liquid water in which most water molecules form four hydrogen bonds and the O-O-O angles deviate from the tetrahedral angle of 109.47°. The thickness of the grain boundaries is ∼1 nm. The diffusion coefficient of water molecules along the grain boundaries calculated in this study, 5.0 × 10-13 m2 s-1, is in good agreement with experimental data. The diffusion along the triple junctions is 3.4 times faster than that along the grain boundaries. We model the grain size dependence of diffusivity of water molecules in polycrystalline ice using the simulation results and find that the impact of the grain boundaries and the triple junctions on the diffusivity is negligible for typical polycrystalline ice samples having grain sizes of the order of millimeters. We also demonstrate that the properties of the grain boundaries are quite different from those of the ice/vapor interface at the same temperature: the quasi-liquid layer at the ice/vapor interface is similar to high-density liquid water and the diffusion coefficient along the ice/vapor interface is two orders of magnitude larger than that along the grain boundaries.","","","Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Okayama University, Okayama 700-8530, Japan.","en","Research Article"

We find two significant effects on the kinetics of the hydrate dissociation by NaCl.

These effects arise from the low solubility of methane in NaCl solution, which gives rise to a nonuniform spatial distribution of solvated methane in the aqueous phase.

As dissociation of the hydrate proceeds, methane molecules are released into the aqueous phase and eventually they form bubbles. It is shown that this bubble formation, which causes change in the methane concentration in the aqueous phase, significantly affects the dissociation kinetics of methane hydrate. A large system size employed in this study makes it possible to analyze the effects of the change in the methane concentration and the formation of bubbles on the dissociation kinetics in detail. It is found that the dissociation rate decreases with time until the bubble formation and then it turns to increase. It is also demonstrated that methane hydrate can exist as a metastable superheated solid if there exists no bubble.","","","Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Okayama University , Okayama, 700-8530, Japan.","en","Research Article"

The ability to encapsulate a material in a nanotube also offers new possibilities for investigating dimensionally confined phase transitions. Particularly intriguing is the conjecture that matter within the narrow confines of a carbon nanotube might exhibit a solid-liquid critical point beyond which the distinction between solid and liquid phases disappears. This unusual feature, which cannot occur in bulk material, would allow for the direct and continuous transformation of liquid matter into a solid. Here we report simulations of the behaviour of water encapsulated in carbon nanotubes that suggest the existence of a variety of new ice phases not seen in bulk ice, and of a solid-liquid critical point. Using carbon nanotubes with diameters ranging from 1.1 nm to 1.4 nm and applied axial pressures of 50 MPa to 500 MPa, we find that water can exhibit a first-order freezing transition to hexagonal and heptagonal ice nanotubes, and a continuous phase transformation into solid-like square or pentagonal ice nanotubes.","","","Department of Chemistry, Fukuoka University of Education, Fukuoka 811-4192, Japan. kenkoga@fukuoka-edu.ac.jp","en","Research Article"

In addition to transitions between high- and low-density amorphous solids, and between high- and low-density liquids, a fragile-to-strong liquid transition has recently been proposed, and supported by evidence from the behaviour of deeply supercooled bilayer water confined in hydrophilic slit pores. Here we report evidence from molecular dynamics simulations for another type of first-order phase transition--a liquid-to-bilayer amorphous transition--above the freezing temperature of bulk water at atmospheric pressure. This transition occurs only when water is confined in a hydrophobic slit pore with a width of less than one nanometre. On cooling, the confined water, which has an imperfect random hydrogen-bonded network, transforms into a bilayer amorphous phase with a perfect network (owing to the formation of various hydrogen-bonded polygons) but no long-range order. The transition shares some characteristics with those observed in tetrahedrally coordinated substances such as liquid silicon, liquid carbon and liquid phosphorus.","","","Department of Chemistry, Fukuoka University of Education, Japan. kenkoga@fukuoka-edu.ac.jp","en","Research Article"

Each ice has a structure that maximizes the number of hydrogen bonds under the cylindrical confinement.

Performing a trajectory calculation of 100 ps, it is found that large rotational motions of individual water molecules, which are always associated with potential energy destabilization of 10?20 kcal/mol, occur once in about 10 ps. The stabilization and destabilization of the individual water molecules are induced by cooperative motions. In order to analyze these cooperative motions in the liquid water, the water structures are quenched to their local minima (called the inherent structures). Comparing the inherent structures successively visited by the system, it is found that collective motions of about 10?40 molecules localized in space occur in unstable regions. The potential energy fluctuation of an individual molecule can reach up to 15 kcal/mol even in the inherent structures. The strong potential energy correlation among neighboring molecules indicates these cooperative motions cause the ??flip?flop???type energy exchanges; as a molecule is stabilized, another is to be unstabilized and vice versa. A flip?flop motion does not involve a (large) energy barrier but causes large energy fluctuations of the individual molecules. A large portion of potential energy fluctuations of the individual water molecules is accounted for as the superposition of fluctuations in the inherent structures and those in the normal modes build upon these structures.","","","","",""

It is found that there exist very large potential energy fluctuations in water; a single water molecule can exhibit a fluctuation of the order of 10?20 kcal/mol. These potential energy fluctuations can be classified into two categories; the fast component (10?14?10?13 s) associated with librational motions of water molecules and the slow component (10?12?10?11 s) associated with water binding structure changes. Both amplitudes can be reached up to 10 kcal/mol. Due to strong Coulomb (dipole?dipole) interaction, small mutual geometrical changes, caused by the libration motions, induce large fast potential energy fluctuations. Due to large cohesion energy of the hydrogen bond and the nature of the water binding structure, there exist many water pair interactions which are unattactive or even repulsive; the water molecule potential (binding) energy distribution is inhomogeneous in space. This inhomogeneity alters as the water structure changes. Each water molecule then makes a transition from a stable binding to an unstable one with surrounding molecules and vice versa, inducing large potential energy changes in the picosecond order. A detailed analysis is made concerning how the hydrogen bonding pattern changes with water molecular motions. Significance of the existence of large water potential energy fluctuations on chemical processes is discussed.","","","","",""

The Gibbs free energy at a given temperature is minimized with respect to the volume of the system.

Evaluated thermal conductivities of clathrate hydrates are lower than those of ice from both types of MD simulations. The evaluated values agree qualitatively with experimental observation. Its anomalous temperature dependence is also reproduced. It is found that those unique properties of clathrate hydrates arise mainly from encaging of guest species and that guest Xe atom even in large cage couples strongly with the host lattice and vibrations relevant to Xe have a large anharmonic contribution. Those modes with large anharmonicity interact with other modes and scatter phonons. This leads to a small thermal conductivity. Increasing temperature changes the ??effective?? potential energy curves of guests in a different way from a the normal crystal. Softening of the modes relevant to guests is suppressed, which is unique in clathrate hydrates reducing anharmonicity of the low frequency modes coupled with guest motions. It is concluded that the most likely mechanism for the anomalies is the resonance scattering model among three accounts proposed so far.","","","","",""

The system upon freezing creates a bilayer ice crystal composed of two layers of hexagonal rings. We perform one simulation at T=257 K during which the system remains a supercooled liquid state, and another one at T=253 K during which the system freezes. Many patterns of molecular arrangement are found upon freezing, and an account is given of the origin of multiple peaks in the distributions of binding energy and pair interaction energy. A definition of the solid-like cluster is introduced in order to analyze the time evolution of the clusters' population and their shapes. A large variety of shapes including highly nonspherical ones can be detected during simulations. A steady population of clusters is found at T=257 K, whereas at T=253 K a post-critical nucleus of the solid phase emerges within a few nanoseconds and continues to grow until the system freezes completely.","","","Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Okayama University, 3-1-1 Tsushimanaka, Okayama 700-8530 Japan.","en","Research Article"

The rotational relaxation times of benzene molecules in both liquid water and clathrate hydrate cages increase with decreasing temperature. At corresponding low temperatures, however, the relaxation time of benzene in the clathrate hydrate is a few times shorter than that in the liquid water, as found recently by NMR experiment.

Those properties of methanol concerning hydrogen bond connectivity are compared with supercooled water. Methanol can be supercooled deep into the low-temperature region without any singular behavior, which is in sharp contrast to supercooled water. One-dimensional linear hydrogen-bonded chains with occasional branches are the predominant species from room temperature to 153 K. The number of hydrogen bonds per methanol molecule in the inherent structure remains constant over a wide range of temperature. Lowering the temperature simply reduces the number of branches, keeping the total number of hydrogen bonds constant. This is caused by a decrease of the methanol molecules hydrogen-bonded with one and three other molecules. It is found that the hydrogen bond strength does not vary with temperature. The potential energy of the inherent structure decreases with a temperature decrease, suggesting that methanol falls into a category of fragile liquid. The energy decrease is due mainly to an increase in density with declining temperature, which strengthens the Lennard-Jones interaction term. This feature is distinguished from water, where hydrogen bonds become gradually stronger with decreasing temperature in the normal supercooled state.","","","","",""

The free energy at a given temperature is minimized with respect to the volume of the system. This enables us to evaluate the thermal expansivity from only intermolecular interaction potentials. The larger thermal expansivity of clathrate hydrates than ice is successfully reproduced.

The most frequent rearrangement is the reorientation of single water molecule rotating 180° around its twofold axis in the network unlike Bjerrum's picture of molecular rotation in ice. Migration of water in the host lattice rarely occurs and very long time (several hundred pico second) is required to complete the rearrangement process since cooperative reorientation of many neighboring water is necessarily accompanied. The correlation of reorientational motion of water appears to decay not with the Debye type but rather with a power-law behavior.","","","","",""

We argue that monitoring the net local solvent density change due to the presence of the solute as well as residual solute chemical potential offers a predictive way of identifying clustering or declustering in infinitely dilute supercritical solutions. Phase diagram-like figures can be obtained, wherein the ‘phase boundaries’ divide the solvent enrichment (or effective attraction) from the solvent depletion (or effective repulsion) region.

Ice Ih is transformed to HDA at 1.27 GPa and 77 K. A very long time (order of a nanosecond) to complete the transition is required. It is found that molecular motions are delocalized in the early stage and become localized in the final stage of the relaxation. LDA is obtained by heating HDA to 160 K. The second peak of the radial distribution function is more clearly separated from the first peak in LDA than in HDA. Few bifurcated hydrogen bonds are found in LDA compared with HDA, which is evidence that LDA resembles crystal ice in short range order. The network topology of the system is also analyzed in terms of the distribution of Voronoi polyhedra, where the density lies between stable HDA and LDA. Density fluctuations are found, which should be attributed to the precursor of a phase separation between HDA and LDA.","","","","en","Research Article"

The theory is used to predict the thermodynamic properties of both pure and mixed fluids, with particular emphasis on the excess properties of the mixture. Comparisons with experiment show moderately good agreement for this complex mixture.

The free energies of proton-disordered hexagonal ice (ice Ih) and liquid water are calculated for the TIP4P [J. Chem. Phys. 79, 926 (1983)] model and the TIP5P [J. Chem.

From the calculated free energy curves, we determine the melting point of the proton-disordered hexagonal ice at 0.1 MPa (atmospheric pressure), 50 MPa, 100 MPa, and 200 MPa. The melting temperatures at atmospheric pressure for the TIP4P ice and the TIP5P ice are found to be about T(m)=229 K and T(m)=268 K, respectively. The melting temperatures decrease as the pressure is increased, a feature consistent with the pressure dependence of the melting point for realistic proton-disordered hexagonal ice. We also calculate the thermal expansivity of the model ices. Negative thermal expansivity is observed at the low temperature region for the TIP4P ice, but not for the TIP5P ice at the ambient pressure.","","","Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Okayama University, 3-1-1 Tsushima, Okayama 700-8530, Japan.","en","Research Article"

A large amount of latent heat is absorbed when ice VII is transformed to the rotator phase at 590 K and 10 GPa, which is a typical characteristic of the plastic transitions for nearly spherical molecules.

An association of hydrophobic groups in methanol can be observed in water-rich mixtures. The association of hydrophobic groups is of the solvent-separated type for the MCY water potential, while the direct contact of hydrophobic groups is favourable for the TIPS water. The qualitative difference in the character of association is examined in terms of the differences in the water-water interaction.

The detailed hydration structures were investigated by means of the so called inherent structures and normal?mode analyses. It was found that the positive excess free energy in the hydration of Xe arises from a decrease in the number of distinct potential?energy minima in configuration space and that the free energy increase in the Ne solution is due partly to the decrease in the number of the potential minima and partly to the anharmonic modes which are harder than those in pure water. The soft anharmonic modes in the Xe solution were almost equivalent to those in pure water. The introduction of a Xe solute gives rise to a change in water structure to a clathrate?like structure and yields an increase in population of the cyclic pentamer connected by hydrogen bonds, which leads to the exothermic hydration.","","","","",""

However, ions in a tube narrower than 1 nm cannot exchange the mutual positions in axial-coordinate within an order of nano second. The axial self-diffusion coefficients are also examined.

We focus on the thermal expansivities and the isothermal compressibilities in the low temperature regime over a wide range of pressures calculated via the intermolecular vibrational free energies. Negative thermal expansivity appears only in the low pressure ice forms. The sign of the thermal expansivity is elucidated in terms of the mode Grüneisen parameters of the low frequency intermolecular vibrational motions. Although the band structure for the low frequency region of the vibrational density of state in the medium pressure ice has a close resemblance to that in the low pressure ice, its response against volume variation is opposite. We reveal that the mixing of translational and rotational motions in the low frequency modes plays a crucial role in the appearance of the negative thermal expansivity in the low pressure ice forms. The medium pressure ices can be further divided into two groups in terms of the hydrogen-bond network flexibility, which is manifested in the properties on the molecular rearrangement against volume variation, notably the isothermal compressibility.","","","Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Science, Okayama University, Okayama 700-8530, Japan.","en","Research Article"

First, we examine the local minimum structure at which the total potential energy has a minimum value for amine and alcohol hydrates and inquire whether, in the absence of thermal fluctuations, the conditions for true?clathrate hydrates are satisfied. The local minimum structures of alcohol hydrates are distinguished from those of stable clathrate hydrates of structures I and II, while amine hydrates hold the host lattice of clathrate hydrates. We argue that the difference between the magnitude of the partial charge on the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl and amino groups plays a much more significant role in the stability of both kinds of clathrate hydrates than the difference in molecular geometry does. Second, we examine kinetic stability by molecular dynamics simulation. Near room temperature the host lattice structure encaging amine remains intact. This is in contrast to the alcohol hydrate, which begins to melt easily with thermal excitation. Interesting is the finding that very long?time?scale (?100 ps) fluctuations of the host potential energy is observed, as well as fast oscillations caused by temporary partial defects in the host network. Clathrate hydrates of polar guest molecules may experience an unstable state in which the host hydrogen?bonded network is partially broken and guest?host hydrogen?bond generation occurs but the stable state of their host lattices is again restored.","","","","",""

For a solute comparable with the water size, the hydrogen bonds among water molecules are strengthened but the net hydrogen bonds number does not increase. These results are also confirmed by the analysis of the geometric patterns formed by the hydrogen bond network.

A simple scheme is given for the estimation of collision probability and the effect of introducing this probability on dynamic behavior is examined in detail for 108 argon atoms as a test simulation. It is established that a collision probability of 0.01 is sufficient to realize the constancy of temperature reasonably well with no appreciable disturbance in the dynamic behavior. A model of pure water with Matsuoka?Clementi?Yoshimine (MCY) potential has also been simulated in the same manner. In the case of 216 MCY water at 298.15 K, the temperature difference is only 0.73 K with a collision probability of 0.005. Various static properties of MCY water have been calculated with reasonable agreement with those by previous Monte Carlo calculation, and moreover, the dynamic behavior calculated for MCY water gives a satisfactory picture on both translational and rotational motions in water, including reasonable agreement of diffusion coefficient with experimental datum.","","","","",""

The total number of molecules was 216, one of which was urea and the temperature was set to 298.15 K and an experimental value was used for the density. For water?water interaction, the MCY (Matsuoka?Clementi?Yoshimine) potential was used, whereas a new potential function was determined for urea?water interaction from SCF LCAO calculations for more than 800 different dimeric configurations with an STO?3G basis set and subsequent multiparameter fitting of the MO results thus obtained to an appropriate functional form by a nonlinear optimization method. The molecular dynamics calculation has been carried out up to 64?000 time steps and from the final 40?000 time steps, thermodynamic quantities, structural and energetic distribution functions, and time?dependent properties were obtained. The original water structure in the vicinity of urea molecule is slightly changed energetically by incorporation of the urea molecule. However, this energy difference is insignificant for the whole system. Instead of the possibility to form strong hydrogen bonding as estimated from the potential function, it is found that urea molecule could enter into the water structure without any appreciable distortion. This fact was confirmed by the angular dependence of any distribution function around the urea molecule. The hydrophilic region does not show a large energetic stabilization between water molecules and the system is stabilized slightly by including urea?water interaction. In contrast to this, the energy for water molecules in the hydrophobic region (above and below the plane containing urea molecule) becomes lower than that of pure water, although this region is small and water molecules cannot form a strong hydrogen bond with urea. This fact reveals that the role of each functional region, which may be either hydrophobic or hydrophilic, is similar to that of alcohol in aqueous solution, although the whole hydration structure of urea molecule is somewhat different from that of alcohol. Reflecting strong interaction of urea?water, the diffusion coefficient for shell water molecules in the vicinity of urea (within 5 Å from urea molecule) becomes smaller by 10%. Moreover, the hydration structure around urea continues for a long time (16 ps), though the energetic relaxation time is very short.","","","","",""

Multidimensional properties of the potential energy surface are explored in terms of vibrational mode excitations at its local energy minima, called inherent structures. The vibrational mode dynamics, especially mechanism of mode relaxation and structure transitions, is analyzed. It shows very strong excitation energy dependence and mode dependence. There are three kinds of vibrational coupling among modes. For excitations of energy near the room temperature, most modes (more than 90% of total modes) individually interact with only one or two other modes, and yield near recurrence of the mode energy in a few tens picoseconds (very slow relaxation). Spatially localized modes in the intermediate frequency range couple with many delocalized modes, yielding fast relaxation. The coupling is governed by atomic displacement overlaps and frequency matching. Each mode couples with nearby frequency or double frequency modes through the Fermi resonance. Lowest frequency modes almost always lead to transitions from a potential energy well to neighbor potential wells, called inherent structure transitions. In high energy excitation, some intermediate frequency modes also yield such transitions. There exist very low energy paths involving single or few water molecule displacements at almost every inherent structure, indicating that certain facile molecular movements occur even in very low temperature states. Different energy excitations of a low frequency mode result in different inherent structure transitions; transitions caused by high energy excitations involve many large molecular displacements. These inherent structure transitions are the source of the water binding structural reorganization dynamics. Significance of these vibrational mode dynamics in the water dynamics is discussed.","","","","",""

We show that the role of water?water interaction is very important in discussing aqueous solutions of alcohols, and examine the origin of the exothermic mixing processes. We have investigated the sensitivity of the temperature dependence of the enthalpy of mixing to the water?water interaction. The CC potential is able to reproduce the temperature dependence observed in experiments, although the absolute values of the mixing enthalpy were larger than the experimental ones. While the TIP4P potential results in better agreement for the excess enthalpy and volume near room temperature, the temperature dependence of the excess enthalpy did not agree with experiment. The difference in the magnitude of the exothermic hydration for different water?water interactions is explained in terms of the energetic stability of the clathrate hydrate compared with ice, on the basis that the structure of water in the vicinity of a methanol molecule is similar to the clathrate hydrate. It is found that the energetic stability of the clathrate hydrate for the CC model is higher than that for TIP4P, and this is responsible for the larger exothermic hydration. The higher stability of the clathrate hydrate structure for the CC potential, in turn, arises from the difference in the pair interaction energy surface between two kinds of potential functions; the minimum energy structure and the flexibility of the hydrogen bonded pair.","","","","",""

The total free energy is divided into several contributions: the interaction between water and guest molecules, the entropic contribution arising from the combinations of cage occupancy, and also the free energy arising from the guest molecular motions inside cages. Our method is based on the generalized van der Waals and Platteeuw theory used for the study of the hydrate encaging propane and is free from some of the fundamental assumptions in the original theory. This enables us to evaluate separately the factors which contribute significantly to the thermodynamic stability of the hydrate, and to address a question as to what extent the original theory is applicable to the prediction of the phase diagrams. While the potential energy curve of the guest molecule with surrounding water molecules in a smaller cage has a single minimum and the molecular motion can be accurately approximated to a collection of harmonic oscillators strongly coupled with the host molecules, the guest molecular motion in a larger cage does not couple with the host. To show evidence that the fixed lattice approximation is sufficient to describe molecular motions inside the larger cage, two kinds of molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out.In one simulation, both host water and guest molecules move according to the classical equations of motion. In another simulation only guest molecules are allowed to move, interacting with fixed host molecules. We perform two kinds of analyses on those motions. In the first analysis, the velocity autocorrelation functions are calculated from molecular dynamics simulations at several temperatures and the power spectra are obtained by the Fourier transform of the correlation functions. In the second, a so?called normal mode analysis is performed and the densities of state for intermolecular vibrations are obtained. The densities of state (corresponding to 0 K) are compared with the power spectra. It is revealed that the fixed lattice approximation can be applied when describing the molecular motions of methane and xenon in larger cages. The free energy for the accommodation of an extremely large CF4 or small argon guest is also examined.","","","","",""

The reconciliation is made on the basis of results from extensive molecular dynamics simulations at constant pressure and temperature. It is found that there exist large gaps around temperature 213 K in thermodynamic, structural, and dynamic properties at atmospheric pressure, suggesting liquid?liquid phase transition. This transition is identified with an extension of the experimentally observed LDA?HDA transition in high pressure to atmospheric pressure. Thus, we propose a new phase diagram where the locus of the second critical point is moved into negative pressure region. With this simple modification, it becomes possible to account for the divergence of the thermodynamic response functions at atmospheric pressure in terms of the critical point and the spinodal?like instability of HDA. The unstable HDA undergoes a transition to LDA phase in lower temperature. The transition is also observed in high pressure region such as 200 MPa while it disappears at negative pressure, ?200 MPa. This reinforces our proposed phase diagram in which there is no continuous path from a supercooled state to LDA at atmospheric pressure. It is argued that the HDA?LDA transition is accompanied by a fragile?strong transition. A possible mechanism of avoiding crystallization of aqueous solutions is also discussed in terms of a difference in hydrogen bond number distribution between LDA and HDA.","","","","",""

But the fact that water tends to lose its anomalous behaviour5 in the pressure range predicted for the new critical point poses problems for such an interpretation. Moreover, the phase diagram derived from these simulations contrasts sharply with another conjecture, whereby it is argued that at atmospheric pressure no thermodynamically continuous path exists between low-density amorphous ice and normal water6.

To further understand these two interactions at the microscopic level, an idealized polyatomic model is devised, which includes hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and partially hydrophilic polyatomic planar square molecular sheets. The hydrophobic molecular sheet is composed of the Lennard-Jones particles while the hydrophilic molecular sheet consists of positive and negative charge sites. In the framework of the extended reference interaction site model integral equation theory the solvent-induced interactions (or the potential of mean forces) between two parallel molecular sheets in water and in the hypothetical nonpolar water are investigated in a systematic fashion. Such a highly idealized model allows us to isolate and to explore the important effects of molecular size, relative intermolecular position (e.g., in- or out-of-registry configuration), and hydrophilic site distribution on the hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions in both water and the hypothetical nonpolar water. Significant insight into these effects at the molecular level is obtained. For the hydrophobic planar molecules in water we find solvent separated hydrophobic interaction becomes less favored as sheet size increases. Moreover, the contact hydrophobic interaction between two molecular sheets in the out-of-registry configuration is always most favorable. For the latter case we find it is the van der Waals attraction, rather than the hydrophobic attraction, that dominates the total interaction. We also find that in both water and the hypothetical nonpolar water the solvent-induced interaction between two hydrophobic sheets behaves similarly. One possible explanation is that the hydrophobic hydration originating from the hydrogen bonding network in water plays an insignificant role in the solvent-induced interaction, at least in the infinitely dilute aqueous solution. For hydrophilic planar molecular sheets in water, we find water-induced hydrophilic interaction is much more substantial compared with the hydrophobic one. In many cases, the hydrophilic interaction is found directly against the intermolecular force between two parallel molecular sheets in vacuum. Finally, for the partially hydrophilic planar molecules in water, a newly discovered feature is that a disperse hydrophilic site distribution gives rise to stronger solvent-induced interaction compared with the clustered hydrophilic site distribution.","","","","",""

Each initial configuration is composed of 288 water molecules with no net dipole moment. The intermolecular interaction of water is described by TIP4P potential. Each production run of the simulation is 15 ns or longer. We observe a change in slope of the DW factor around 200 K, which cannot be explained within the framework of either classical or quantum harmonic approximation. Configurations generated by MD simulations are subjected to the steepest descent energy minimization. Analysis of the local energy minimum structures reveals that water molecules above 200 K jump to other lattice sites via some local energy minimum structures which contain some water molecules sitting on the locations other than the lattice sites. As time evolves, these defect molecules move back and forth to the lattice sites yielding defect-free structures. Those motions are responsible for the unusual increase in the DW factor at high temperatures. In making a transition from an energy-minimum structure to another one, a small number of water molecules are involved in a highly cooperative fashion. The larger DW factor at higher temperature arises from jump-like motions of water molecules among these locally stable configurations which may or may not be a family of the proton-disordered ice forms satisfying the ""ice rule"".","","","Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Okayama University, 3-1-1 Tsushima-naka, Okayama 700-8530, Japan.","en","Research Article"

Using a previously introduced solid-like cluster definition, we monitor the dynamic process of crystallization.

Accommodation of a large guest molecule makes the frequencies of the lattice vibrational motions higher, which is one of the breakdowns of the assumptions in the original van der Waals and Platteeuw theory. The frequency modulations are incorporated in the free energy of cage occupation in the present method. Moreover, the reference state, which is originally the corresponding empty clathrate structure, is alternated to a state where cages of at least one sort are fully occupied. This meets the stability condition of clathrate hydrates that most of the cages should be accommodated. Owing to this new reference state, the thermodynamic stability is evaluated with reasonable accuracy from the free energy of cage occupation especially by a large guest molecule without considering its dependence on the cage occupancy. This conversion is also beneficial to establish a relation between the chemical potential of water and the cage occupancy from grandcanonical Monte Carlo simulation. We show a new method indeed works well in predicting the dissociation pressures of clathrate hydrates containing isobutane, propane, ethane, Xe, and CF(4).","","","Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, 3-1-1 Tsushima, Okayama 700-8530, Japan. htanakaa@cc.okayama-u.ac.jp","en","Research Article"

We estimate water/hydrate and hydrate/guest two-phase coexisting conditions in the temperature, pressure, and composition space in addition to three-phase equilibrium conditions. It is shown that the occupancy of guest molecules and the two-phase boundaries in the phase diagram vary depending sensitively on its size. Enthalpy components arising from the host and guest interactions are separately calculated from the temperature dependence of the corresponding free energy values. This enables to evaluate the dissociation enthalpy at any stable and metastable thermodynamic state taking account of the phase transition in the coexisting phase such as melting of ice, notably that along the three-phase equilibrium line.","","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Science, Okayama University Okayama Japan","en",""

In this Letter we argue that a large system size simulation is required only when the surface free energy of domains is large in the course of the phase separation, which usually occurs when the system is quenched deeply into a two-phase region. For a shallow quench, however, the ‘loop’ effect is not serious because of the small surface free energy of domains. We also show that such a shallow quench can also be achieved effectively by reducing the attractive part of intennolecular potential while retaining the repulsive part of the potential at the same system temperature.","","","","",""

Our evaluation of the phase behaviors is performed by setting up quantum partition functions with variable pressures on the basis of a rigorous statistical mechanics theory that requires only the intermolecular interactions as input. Noble gases, hydrocarbons, nitrogen, and oxygen are chosen as the guest species, which are key components of the volatiles in such satellites. We explore the hydrate/water two-phase boundary of those clathrate hydrates in water-rich conditions and the hydrate/guest two-phase boundary in guest-rich conditions, either of which occurs on the surface or subsurface of icy satellites. The obtained phase diagrams indicate that clathrate hydrates can be in equilibrium with either water or the guest species over a wide range far distant from the three-phase coexistence condition and that the stable pressure zone of each clathrate hydrate expands significantly on intense cooling. The implication of our findings for the stable form of water in Titan is that water on the surface exists only as clathrate hydrate with the atmosphere down to a shallow region of the crust, but clathrate hydrate in the remaining part of the crust can coexist with water ice.

At the local minima of those two hydrates, the potential energies of water-water and guest-water, and their hydrogen bonded networks are compared. It is found that methanol does not retain the host lattice structure, while the host-network structure is kept in the presence of methylamine. It is shown that the difference in the magnitude of the partial charge on the hydrogen atom between the hydroxyl and amino groups plays a much more significant role on the stability of both clathrate hydrates than the difference in molecular geometry.

The results show that the F2  HF and Cl2  HF complexes are stabilized by 10.50 and 5.2kJ/mol respectively. A partial charge transfer from the halogen molecules (X2) to HF occurs. The X2 molecules are polarized and the X atoms which are not hydrogen-bonded to HF carry a partial positive charge, making the complexes suitable for the dipole-induced dipole interaction with graphite. Furthermore, the X2 molecules interacting with HF can be regarded as easily polarizable, large “soft oxidants“, facilitating the subsequent charge transfer from graphite. HF plays a catalytic role both in intercalation and deintercalation processes. In contrast with fluorine, the reaction of chlorine with graphite in the presence of liquid HF barely yielded a stage-two compound after a prolonged reaction time, which was in agreement with the results of calculation. The lower reactivity of chlorine is attributed to the weaker interaction of Cl2 with HF and its smaller oxidizing ability.","","","","en",""

The solute species under investigation were neon and xenon. The structures and thermodynamic properties relevant to the hydration processes were analyzed based upon the quenching of the system to local potential energy minima. It was found that the two solutes give rise to qualitatively different hydration structures; the introduction of Xe atoms make a significant water structure enhancement, increasing the population of pentagonal hydrogen bond network. The solution of neon with usual size parameter and combining rule failed to reproduce the experimentally observed properties. The structural change in quenched state was seen in the Ne solution where a somewhat larger size parameter was adopted. In normal mode analysis, the potential energy was expanded up to quadratic order around quenched configurations. Free energy and entropy changes in the hydration were evaluated for these aqueous harmonic systems. It was shown that a substantial part of the negative entropy change in hydration of apolar molecules experimentally observed arises from the differences in molecular rearrangement and anharmonic rather than harmonic motions.","","","","en",""

However, vague or insufficient characterization of the environmental conditions prevents us from a comprehensive understanding of even equilibrium properties of CH4-CO2 hydrates for this substitution. We propose possible reaction schemes for the substitution, paying special attention to the coexisting phases, the aqueous and/or the fluid, where CO2 is supplied from and CH4 is transferred to. We address the two schemes for the substitution operating in three-phase and two-phase coexistence. Advantages and efficiencies of extracting CH4 in the individual scheme are estimated from the chemical potentials of all the components in all the phases involved in the substitution on the basis of a statistical mechanical theory developed recently. It is found that although substitution is feasible in the three-phase coexistence, its working window in temperature-pressure space is much narrower compared to the two-phase coexistence condition. Despite that the substitution normally generates only a small amount of heat, a large endothermic substitution is suggested in the medium pressure range, caused by the vaporization of liquid CO2 due to mixing with a small amount of the released CH4. This study provides the first theoretical framework toward the practical use of hydrates replacing CH4 with CO2 and serves as a basis for quantitative planning.","","","Toyota Physical and Chemical Research Institute, Nagakute 480-1192, Japan.

The topological constraints imposed by the ice rules, in which water molecules form directed cyclic paths of hydrogen bonds, cancel out the variability of local interactions.

In Paper I [T. Yagasaki et al., J. Chem.

The melting temperature of the zeolite-like ice structure is much higher than the melting temperature of ice Ih when the distance between the surfaces of CNTs is ∼0.94 nm, which is the best spacing for the bilayer structure of water. In this paper, we perform MD simulations of nanobrushes of CNTs that are different from (6,6) CNTs in radius. Several new porous ice structures form spontaneously in the MD simulations. A stable porous ice forms when the radius of its cavities matches the radius of the CNTs well. All cylindrical porous ice structures found in this study can be decomposed into a small number of structural blocks. We provide a new protocol to classify cylindrical porous ice crystals on the basis of this decomposition.","","","Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Science, Okayama University, Okayama 700-8530, Japan.

Two- and three-phase coexisting conditions in the whole space of thermodynamic variables (temperature, pressure, and composition) are evaluated only from intermolecular interactions for water and guest species. The occupancy of guest molecules in various types of cages is also calculated. We find that a small difference in the guest size gives rise to a rich variety of phase behaviors, notably for the shape of the two-phase boundary and the occupancy. Ethane clathrate hydrate is found to exhibit the most drastic and intriguing features in various properties arising from its non-stoichiometry. We investigate the phase behaviors of clathrate hydrate in terms of the partial molar quantities derived from the chemical potentials of guest and water. Our method also allows exploring the aqueous solution of an apolar guest molecule in the low temperature and high pressure regime coexisting with the corresponding clathrate hydrate for which the free guest fluid phase is substituted at high temperatures. It is shown that the temperature dependence of methane solubility in liquid water in the presence of clathrate hydrate is opposite to that being in equilibrium with the methane fluid without clathrate hydrate. This phenomenon is elucidated by a substantial decrease in the chemical potential of methane from the hydrate/guest boundary to the hydrate/water.","","","Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Science, Okayama University, Okayama 700-8530, Japan.","en","Research Article"

This negative thermal expansivity has been explored in terms of phonon frequency modulation with varying volume and attributed to the negative Grüneisen parameters unique mostly to tetrahedrally coordinated substances. However, an underlying mechanism for the negative Grüneisen parameters has not been known except some schematic analyses. We investigate in this study the characteristics of the intermolecular vibrational modes whose Grüneisen parameters are negative by examining the individual vibrational modes rigorously. It is found that the low frequency modes below 100 cm?1, which we explicitly show are mostly bending motions of three hydrogen-bonded molecules, necessarily accompany elongation of the hydrogen bond length at peak amplitudes compared with that at the equilibrium position in executing the vibrational motions. The elongation gives rise to a decrease in the repulsive interaction while an increase in the Coulombic one. The decrease in the repulsive interaction is relaxed substantially by expansion due to its steep slope against molecular separation compared with the sluggish increase in the Coulombic one, and therefore, the negative Grüneisen parameters are obtainable. This scenario is tested against some variants of cubic ice with various water potential models. It is demonstrated that four interaction-site models are suitable to describe the intermolecular vibrations and the thermal expansivity because of the moderate tendency to favor the tetrahedral coordination.","","","Toyota Physical and Chemical Research Institute, Nagakute 480-1192, Japan.

The most stable structure is revealed by the generalized phase diagram, where the chemical potential differences in the three canonical forms of clathrates are independent variables. The most stable structure incorporating individual guest species is evaluated by the locus of the chemical potential differences on this generalized phase diagram. We show that the method developed here is simple but powerful to estimate roughly phase behaviors of clathrate compounds in a wide range of thermodynamic conditions, which is demonstrated by two applications: the generalized phase diagram of group 14 element clathrates and the phase behavior of mixed gas hydrates. The present theory leads to proposals of phase change agents, of which the addition sensitively influences the structure selectivity, encompassing even minor structures.","","","Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Science, Okayama University, Okayama, Okayama 700-8530, Japan; Toyota Physical and Chemical Research Institute, Nagakute, Aichi 480-1192, Japan","en",""

The free energies of these ice forms are calculated to obtain the lattice constants for the tetragonal unit cell and the thermal expansivities at various thermodynamic conditions in the framework of quasi-harmonic approximation, taking account of their anisotropic nature. The thermal expansivities are also examined by applying a thermodynamic relation that connects them with the Grüneisen parameters and the elastic compliances. Both calculations suggest that ice III and IX exhibit a negative thermal expansion along the a-axis but have a positive one along the c-axis at low temperatures. It is found that nonaffine deformation in the variation of the lattice constant beyond affine transformation (the Born approximation) is essential in the theoretical calculation of the thermal properties of ice III and IX. We also find that the nonaffine deformation is described by the shift of the minimum energy positions in the potential manifold of hydrogen-ordered ice along a limited number of the normal mode coordinates, which is irrelevant to the system size. These modes become unstable against an applied strain, so that the potential minimum moves along those normal coordinates away from that of the affine-transformed structure. The unstable modes are all symmetry-preserving modes, and the space-group symmetry is an invariant under displacement along either of those normal coordinates. The number of the unstable modes in ice IX is 8 while it is 1 in another hydrogen-ordered ice VIII.","","","Toyota Physical and Chemical Research Institute, Nagakute 480-1192, Japan.

The two boundaries separating water and hydrate and hydrate and guest fluid mixtures are estimated, which are extended to the lower temperature and the higher pressure region far distant from the three-phase coexisting conditions. The chemical potentials of individual guest components can be calculated from free energies of cage occupations, which are available from intermolecular interactions between host water and guest molecules. This allows us to derive all thermodynamic properties pertinent to the phase behaviors in the whole space of thermodynamic variables of temperature, pressure, and guest compositions. It is found that the phase boundaries of CH4-CO2 binary hydrates with water and with fluid mixtures locate between simple CH4 and CO2 hydrates, but the composition ratios of CH4 guests in hydrates are disproportional to those in fluid mixtures. Such differences arise from the affinities of each guest species to the large and small cages of CS-I hydrates and significantly affect occupation of each cage type, which results in a deviation of the guest composition in hydrates from that in fluid on the two-phase equilibrium conditions. The present method provides a basis for the evaluation of the efficiency of the guest CH4 replacement to CO2 at the thermodynamic limit.","","","Toyota Physical and Chemical Research Institute, Nagakute 480-1192, Japan.
